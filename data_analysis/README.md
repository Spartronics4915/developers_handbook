# Data Analysis

During competitions, the team will collect scouting data on the performance of other teams. These data can serve a number of purposes, such as:

* Ranking potential alliance partners
* Evaluating new strategies and robot enhancements
* Publishing match analyses

# Scouting

Scouting data is recorded using a mobile application customized for each year's game. Students are assigned to each match to ensure that we have complete coverage.
