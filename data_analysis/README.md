# Data Analysis

During competitions, the team collects scouting data on the performance of other teams. These data can serve a number of purposes, such as:

- Ranking potential alliance partners
- Evaluating new strategies and robot enhancements
- Publishing match analyses

## Scouting

Scouting data is recorded using a mobile application customized for each year's game. Students are assigned to each match to ensure that we have complete coverage.

## Anaconda Navigator

We use [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to launch either a [Python](http://www.python.org) or [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming and data analysis environment.

Download Anaconda Navigator [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Select the **Python 3.7 version** (or the latest Python 3 version) for your operating system, and follow the installation instructions.

When first started, Anaconda Navigator opens a browser with several launcher tiles. We primarily use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which can run either Python or R code in a notebook format.
