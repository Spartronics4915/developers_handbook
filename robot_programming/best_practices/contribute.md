# Contribution Guidelines

The goal of this repository is to go above and beyond the information present in the [FRC Control System documentation](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485) provided by WPI. Content should be full of links to important external sources (including to the WPI documentation), helpful diagrams, code examples and thorough easy to follow instructions.

When adding content to this document, include it in the appropriate directory, or subdirectory if necessary. The top-level files are:

- [README.md](README.md)         - the first introduction to the document
- [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md)       - the table of contents and required by GitBook
- [contribute.md](contribute.md) - the document contribution guidelines
- [todo.md](todo.md)             - a placeholder for content to be added to the document

For content to be included in the GitBook, it must be in a markdown file (extension .md) and be included as a bullet pointed link in SUMMARY.md.

## Naming Conventions

**File and folder names will be lowercase only, and will separate words using underscores.** Keep file and folder names short when possible. The only exception to lowercase file names is in the case of README.md and SUMMARY.md.

## Subdirectories

Each top level directory is roughly a large chapter of the document. These chapters can have subsections which either are individual markdown files or its own subdirectory, depending on the size of the subsection. The file that is intended as the first file read in each directory and subdirectory should be named README.md so that GitHub will automatically display it.

Images should be included in a separate directory named images/ at the same level as the markdown page they are contained in.
If multiple markdown files reference the same image, the image file should be contained in each appropriate images/ directory.

Code examples should be included in a separate subdirectory for each top level directory where appropriate.
Code examples are never to be linked to like other markdown files - instead, links to these code examples should be directed at their location on [Spartronics4915's repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Spartronics4915/developers_handbook).

## Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a basic word syntax system commonly used for web development.
It's simple syntax makes it ideal for writing for a variety of different browsers and interpreters.

[Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
is an excellent guide to the basics of markdown syntax and is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in contributing to this document.

You can use any plain text editor to read and edit .md files. One powerful editor for this purpose is [Atom](atom.io), made by GitHub. It has a robust plugin system, allowing for a fully customizable and hackable text editor.
It also features a built in Markdown preview feature to view the resulting markdown live. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) also has a preview function, accessable by the shortcut (Ctrl + K, V).

### Markdown Basics

#### Line breaks

Markdown treats one line break like a space - this allows us to format the raw document for easy reading.

To separate paragraphs, you must use two line breaks.

#### Text

```
Italics: *word* or _word_
Bold: **word** or __word__
Bold and Italic: ***word** or ___word___
```

_word_\
**word**\
_**word**_

#### Headers

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
etc.
```

#### Lists

Unordered - use either * or -.

```
* Entry
- Entry
    * Subentry
- Another entry
* A final entry
```

Ordered - use numbers. Markdown will automatically present it in increasing
order beginning at 1.

```
1. First entry
2. Second entry
    1. First subentry
3. Third entry
4. Fourth and final entry
```

#### Links

```
[Text for link](link_address)
```

You can use this link system for a lot of different things.

* To link to an external website, replace link_address
with the desired web address.

* To link to another markdown file in the document, replace link_address
with the relative path of the file. (/ tells Gitbook to start in the base
directory, while ./ or nothing tells it to start in the current folder.)

* To link to a header in the same document, replace link_address
with #header-name, where header-name is the text of the header in lowercase
and with all spaces replaced with '-'. Use only one '#' regardless of the
level of header.

#### Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks disable Markdown syntax and puts code in nice little readable boxes.

```Inline `code` has `back-ticks` around it.```

Many websites also support using

\`\`\`language

\`\`\`

to create syntax higlighting. For example,

    ```java

    public class math {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            double three = add(1.0, 2.0);
            System.out.println(three);
        }
        public static double add (double a, double b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

    ```

produces

```java

public class math {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double three = add(1.0, 2.0);
        System.out.println(three);
    }
    public static double add (double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

```
