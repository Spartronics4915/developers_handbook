# Setting up your Development Environment

WPI's documentation has greatly improved in the recent years. As development environments often if not always vary year-to-year, we now recommend following the latest version of the guide for your system at [FIRST's ReadTheDocs.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)

Note that because of the size of the official installer (over a gigabyte!), your past programming leads strongly recommend either downloading it beforehand onto a USB, or taking turns using the unthrottled Ethernet cables available in classrooms.

Team-specific configurations or those not covered by the official documentation will remain here.
