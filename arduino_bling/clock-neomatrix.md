# Spartronics Clock and Adafruit NeoMatrix

See [Spartronics Clock repo](https://github.com/riyadth/spartronics_clock)
for code and instructions on how we track time till critical events.
Note that the Spartronics clock is not using an Arduino Uno.
It uses a more powerful system called the Teensy LC.
