# Vision

Our Vision solution every year is typically game-independent, with each year having similar tracking targets and goals.

As such, because so much Vision code is reused and builds on itself year-to-year, we keep our codebase in a single repository.
The yearly documentation for such is located there and intertwined with the code.
