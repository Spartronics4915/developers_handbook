# Method Definitions
You've now called a number of methods, like `Math.max(2.0, 3.0);`, but how would
you define such a method?

_(This method returns the larger of the two numbers you pass in, by the way. In this example, it would return `3.0`.)_

A little bit like this:

```java
public class Math {
  public static double max(double a, double b) {
    if (a > b) {
      return a;
    }
    return b;
  }
}
```

Let's break this down.

## Method Signature
The method's _signature_ is the following:
`public static double max(double a, double b)`

The signature says what the method takes, and what the method returns, along
with other information that we'll cover later.
 1. `public`: This means that the method can be called outside of the `Math`
    class. We'll cover this more in chapter 6.
 2. `static`: We'll cover this more in chapter 6.
 3. `double`: This method returns a `double`. This can be any data type (`int`,
    `String`, etc.) _or_ `void`, which means that the method returns nothing.
 4. `max(double a, double b)`: The method is called max, and takes two
    parameters: `a`, which is a `double`, and `b` which is also a `double`.

## Return Keyword
There's another new piece of syntax here: the `return` keyword. The idea is that
when you `return`, the method immediately exits at that point. If the return
type of your method is `void`, you can just do `return;`. If the return type is
_not_ `void`, you must return something of the appropriate data type. E.g. if
your return type is `double`, this will work: `return 3.1;`, but this will not:
`return "foo";`.

@TODO: method overloading?
