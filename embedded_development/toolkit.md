# Arduiono IDE: Installation and Setup

It takes just a few steps to start with Arduino development and fun experiments with bling.

## Step 1: Install Arduino IDE
We recommend installing Arduino Desktop IDE. Follow the [instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) to setup the environment for your OS.

## Step 2: Configure IDE for the right board
Once your IDE is setup, specify the Arduino board: *Tools/Board* menu

## Step 3: Configure IDE for the right port
In order to upload your code, IDE needs to be configured for the right port: *Tools/Port* menu

## Step 4: Install the libraries needed
Your code likely depends on other libraries, Adafruit NeoPixel library for our bling examples. *Tools/Manage Libraries...* menu to add/remove installed libraries.
